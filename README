Info
====

Raytraced morphing Julia quaternion fractal.
Tested OK on windows 10 platform, no requires DX11 to be installed.


Source
======

The original Cg code is by [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/QuaternionJulia/)
Then ported to HLSL by [Jan Vlietinck] (http://users.skynet.be/fquake/)
But the source cannot build on Windows 10 because of old DX APIs, so I ported it again to make it
build OK on Windows 10 platform. The default configuration is Release x64.
